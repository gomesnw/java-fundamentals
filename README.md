# Java Fundamentals

Java fundamentals and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) exercises focused on backend development.

This repository contains practical exercises developed during my Java studies, with a focus on solidifying core concepts of object-oriented programming and backend foundations.

The main goal of this repository is to consolidate essential Java concepts that will serve as a foundation for future Spring Boot and backend development.

## Concepts Covered

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Encapsulation
- Constructors and Method Overloading
- Composition
- Enumerations (Enums)
- Date and Time API (`LocalDate`, `LocalDateTime`, `Instant`)
- `StringBuilder`
- Inheritance and Polymorphism *(in progress)*

## Repository Structure

- **social-media-post**  
  Social media post simulation using composition and `StringBuilder`.

- **worker-contracts**  
  Worker income calculation based on hourly contracts, using composition and enums.

## Status

This repository is under continuous development as part of my Java learning journey.  
New exercises and improvements will be added as I progress toward Spring Boot and backend development.
