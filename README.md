Java fundamentals and OOP exercises focused on backend development

This repository contains practical exercises developed during my Java studies,
with a focus on object-oriented programming and backend foundations.

The goal of this repository is to consolidate core Java concepts that serve as
a foundation for future Spring Boot and backend development.

## Concepts covered

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Encapsulation
- Constructors and method overloading
- Composition
- Enumerations (Enums)
- Date and Time API (LocalDate, LocalDateTime, Instant)
- StringBuilder
- Inheritance and Polymorphism (in progress)

## Repository structure

- `agenda` — Simple agenda system to practice OOP, composition, and dates
- `worker-contracts` — Income calculation using composition and enums
- `social-posts` — Social media post simulation using composition and StringBuilder
- `inheritance-polymorphism` — Exercises focused on inheritance and polymorphism

## Status

This repository is under continuous development as part of my Java learning journey.
New exercises and improvements will be added as I progress toward Spring Boot.
